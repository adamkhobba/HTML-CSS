	<h1 id="top">Thread</h1>
	<h2>Defintion</h2>
	<p>Threads in C are a way to achieve concurrent execution of code,
		allowing a program to perform multiple operations simultaneously.
		This is particularly useful for tasks that can be executed independently,
		such as handling multiple client connections in a server or performing background
		computations while maintaining responsiveness in the main application.
		<mark>created byedsger Dijkstra</mark></p>
	<h2>Parallelism vs concurrency</h2>
	<p>Concurrent and parallel are effectively the same principle as you correctly surmise,
		both are related to tasks being executed simultaneously although I would say that parallel
		tasks should be truly multitasking, executed "at the same time" whereas concurrent could mean that
		the tasks are sharing the execution thread while still appearing to be executing in parallel.
	</p>
	<h1>Multi-threading Models</h1>
	<h2>Many-to-One Model</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Many user-level threads mapped to single kernel thread</li>
		<li>One thread blocking causes all to block</li>
		<li>Thread management done by user-level threads library</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>One-to-One Model</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Each user-level thread maps to kernel thread</li>
		<li>One thread blocking does not cause others to block</li>
		<li>Thread management done by kernel</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>Many-to-Many Model</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Many user-level threads mapped to many kernel threads</li>
		<li>Allows the operating system to create a sufficient number of kernel threads</li>
		<li>Thread management done by user-level threads library</li>
	</ul>
	<h1>Mutual exclusion (Mutex)</h1>
	<h2>Definition</h2>
	<p>A mutex is a lock that is used to protect shared data from being simultaneously accessed by multiple threads.
		When a thread acquires a mutex, it has exclusive access to the shared data until it releases the mutex.
		This prevents other threads from accessing the shared data while it is being modified, ensuring that the data remains consistent.
	</p>
	<h2>Dead lock</h2>
	<h3>Definition</h3>
	<p>A deadlock is a situation in which two or more threads are waiting for each other to release a resource that they need,
		preventing all of them from making progress. Deadlocks can occur when multiple threads acquire locks in a different order,
		creating a circular dependency that prevents any of them from releasing their locks.
	</p>
	<h1 id="bonus">Semaphore</h1>
	<h2>Definition</h2>
	<p>A semaphore is a synchronization primitive that is used to control access to a shared resource by multiple threads.
		It maintains a count that represents the number of available resources, and provides operations to acquire and release resources.
		When a thread acquires a semaphore, it decrements the count, and when it releases the semaphore, it increments the count.
	</p>
	<h2>named semaphore</h2>
	<h3>Definition</h3>
	<p>A named semaphore is a semaphore that is identified by a unique name in the system, allowing multiple processes to access the same semaphore.
		This is useful for coordinating access to shared resources between different processes, such as in a client-server application.
	</p>
	<h2>unnamed semaphore</h2>
	<h3>Definition</h3>
	<p>An unnamed semaphore is a semaphore that is not identified by a unique name in the system, and is used for synchronization between threads within the same process.
		This is useful for coordinating access to shared resources between different threads in a multi-threaded application.
